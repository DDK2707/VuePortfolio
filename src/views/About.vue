        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h5>I am an introspective and observant individual who is able to work to the best of my ability both in
        groups and alone. I don't usually feel comfortable being in large groups, but will warm up to those in
        the group given the opportunity to form relationships. Furthermore, I have been told that I have a
        friendly demeanour, despite outward appearances, and am always ready to make others smile. Something that I could stand to learn
        is to be more assertive and confident in myself and my ideas.
        </h5>
        <h5>My interest in coding comes from my hobbies. I am passionate about video games, having played for almost 14
        years, and have recently been swept up by researching different hardware options for my eventual PC
        upgrade. I want to grow my skillset to be a more appealing and well-rounded potential employee as well as cultivate skills that can help me be more
        connected and involved with the things that I enjoy.
